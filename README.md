My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

For the `.js` files, they are meant to be run in browser console on the input page.

For the `.cpp` or `.py` files, they usually read input from `input.txt`, or sometimes hardcoded.

Some of the files are not exactly what I coded to solve the puzzle; they get beautified a bit when I archive them.
